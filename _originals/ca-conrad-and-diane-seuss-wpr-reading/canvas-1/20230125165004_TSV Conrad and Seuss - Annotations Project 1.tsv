0:00:08	14	1. Woodberry Poetry Room 2. Vocarium Reading Series / CA Conrad & Diane Seuss October 18, 2021)	Intertitle	
0:00:18		A white blond woman wearing black and cat-eye glasses sits in her living room in a close-up. Behind her is a mirror, book shelf, table with unidentifiable knick-knacks, a bright lamp, and drawn blind. It is night.	Image	
0:00:18	26	CD: Good evening and welcome to tonight's reading by two authors that share a committemnt to manifesting frankness in all its forms.	Transcription	
27	37	CD: Frank, being not of beloved beings seared onto the covers of their best known books, but also an ethics of liberation. 	Transcription	ethics
38	44	CD: Frankness, coming from the root word meaning free, an ethos that extends far beyond the page	Transcription	ethics
45	58	CD: They do not, as Will Alexander writes, forbid themselves their own volcanism, or let gradually themselves be silenced or confined by pre-existing forms or formations.	Transcription	Alexander
59	71	CD: They are as Adrienne Rich once said of Dickinson, volcanoes in the house of poetry, with what Terence Hayes has called, tenacity and intensity, with rage and grace	Transcription	Rich, Dickinson, Hayes
72	90	CD: They do us the supreme justice of presenting the full-blowness and dimensionality of our being. I rejoice in their freedom which is never a past tense of freedom but always seems to be occurring in the permanent precarious now of their work.	Transcription	freedom
91	102	CD: In this quality and others I find they resonate with the writings of the late, great Diane di Prima. And with the work of our introducer tonight, the one and only Ariana Reines. 	Transcription	diPrima
102	118	CD: Ariana had a last minute travel change, no doubt some residual mercury retrogration is in the air. In lieu, of her live presence tonight she has offered this thoughtful, substantive, and downright inimitable mediation.	Transcription	
119	124	CD: Please welcome the pre-recorded but no less powerful Ariana Reines.	Transcription	
126		A white blond woman with curly hair, wearing a red sweater, black rimmed glasses, and a nose ring sits at a low angle. There is a large green leafy plant in the foreground next to her, another green leafy plant in the background, and a book shelf with an assortment of books. There is a blind half lowered and it appears to be night. This looks like her home office. 	Image	
126	136	AR: Hello. My name is Ariana Reines and it's my thrill and honor to be introducing CA Conrad and Diane Seuss to you tonight. 	Transcription	
138	148	AR: Welcome to the Woodberry Poetry Room at Harvard, uh, virtually. This is a very, very special place. 	Transcription	
148	164	AR: And before I say a few words about Conrad and Diane's work, I want to acknowledge the poet Christina Davis who curates this series and who masterfully runs this space. 	Transcription	
164	185	AR: Um, the Woodberry Poetry Room is the beating heart and soul of a place that is very hostile to beating heart and soul. And um I din't want to be a dick so I won't tell you what I'm referring to but you all know I'm talking about a certain institution 	Transcription	
186	201	AR: But I'm really also talking about as we know it right now. Um Poetry is a place we go to be refreshed. The soul is reborn through it.	Transcription	
202	224	AR: And I think language itself wants to go into poetry to find refreshment too. And that those of us who have it flowing through us find language pushing us driving us into that place to quench our thirst and to find resurrection. 	Transcription	
224	258	AR: And I see tonight as a resurrectionary night. Um, mercury goes direct today Monday, October 18th 2021. And I don't know about you but the mercury in retrograde we've just been through, hump, we're still dealing with it was definitely the heaviest and harshest mercury in retrograde possibly in my entire life. 	Transcription	
259	281	AR: So I'm really excited that this event can act as a portal to usher us into the new world. The new world that happens after we've been refreshed by these poems and by these poets. I'm going to confine my remarks mostly to the newest books by both. 	Transcription	
282	310	AR: Because in a way we're celebrating these books tonight. Amanda Paradise is jusst out from Wave and CA Conrad I imagine will be reading from that book. Althought they write so much we could be hearing brand new things. And Diane Seuss has a new book from Graywolf called Frank and it is a sequence of sonnets constituing a kind of a memoir but more than a memoir.	Transcription	
311	341	AR: And both are really really powerful extraordinary stunning works. Just a few words about some things that I see both poets have in common. Because they are very diffreent poets but there are worlds that their poetry returns to me and there are places in me that their poetry reaches that a lot of poetry doesn't.	Transcription	
347	378	AR: Death and elegy are a major part of the work of both these poets. But their work absolutely pulses with life and you have the sense that althought technical mastery is on display in every line in every word in every cut of the line on every page for both poets that these are people pulsing with life for whom the dry and technical the merely excellent is not enough. 	Transcription	
381	411	AR: And I love that about both of them. There's so much blood and guts there is sex and tears there is solitude loneliness, mournfulness, fury, there is real life shit and there is social shit, family shit. the impossible filth of desire	Transcription	
411	427	AR: And the purity of being and a sense that you can expand yourself to encompass all this and include all this. that is something that the work of both poets gives. 	Transcription	
430	463	AR: So a few words about my friend CA Conrad and their new book Amanda Paradise as they are reading first tonight. I really believe that it is the singular charisma and also immense generosity, the magnitude of CA Conrads work that has made a lot of snobby people and dried up souls suddenly open themselves to magic. 	Transcription	
467	488	AR: Conrad wouldnt like it, I dont think for me to say that its them that its because of them that there is a certain curiousity if not respect for certain modes of being and of experience that go beyond the empirically-ratified. 	Transcription	
490	511	AR: But I really do believe that way they have trained their voice, the way that they have fearlessly described their methods, and the charisma with which theyve delivered all this into the halls of academe and the highest palaces of art all across the globe 	Transcription	
512	529	AR: people have found themselves interested in arts potential to heal not as some thing they look down upon or something femmes do but as something really serious and worthy of genuine curiousity.	Transcription	
530	552	AR: Conrad has a warrior spirit and they are a warrior for art for life and for love. They are totally without pretension. As long as I've known them they are always giving out broadsides doing their poetry and their reiki and their healing work in any place that they can	Transcription	
553	579	AR: However fancy, however random fearlessly. Which is not to say they are not senstivie enough to feel fear. They are a Warrior. Amanda Paradise is resurrectionary in the way that all of their books are but in a very very particular way	Transcription	
580	603	AR:There's a tenderness in these poems that is aching and searing. They are filled with love and sex and an understanding of the absolute waste of the way that we let ourselves and our souls die.	Transcription	
606	629	AR: In this mechanistic culture and Conrad's entire poetics is a war against the mechanistic deadening of the soul and the renewing and continually renovating creativity that their work shows is a testament to the healing power of their methods.	Transcription	
632	650	AR: Resurrect Extinct Vibration was maybe the first somatic and the first poem of this book that I encountered and I got to hear Conrad read from it and the courage of it overwhelmed me at the time.	Transcription	
651	684	AR: Conrad uses their body in order to face these enormous realities that are very difficult for us to grasp in our senses. Not cutting their hair until the war ends, but it has been forever war for as long as Ive been an adult, filling their body with the sound or bird song extinct bird song, filling their body with vile political speeches.	Transcription	
685	697	AR: Willingly using their body as an organ as an instrument in order to produce the visionary poems that save our lives	Transcription	
705	736	AR: Diane Seuss's new book Frank is an absolutely virtuousic and spellbinding memoir in verse. Its a sequence of sonnets by someone so wild, a spirit so wild it its just absolutely hilarious and wonderful the way taht this old form has accommodated her absolutely endless mind 	Transcription	
737	754	AR: And she returns me to the original soneteers who I think were pretty groovy too, It is interesting that such tiday, pert, tart little form could accommodate so much. 	Transcription	
755	782	AR: Frank is an absolutely devastating, gorgeous, luscious book. THinking of its cousins I thought of Frank Stanford, Wanda Coleman, and the late James Schuyler, the later Schuyler, but really Diane Seuss is Seussian just as Conrad is Conradian. These two poets who are really, really without compare.	Transcription	
790	824	AR: I adored reading this book. I could not put it down. I saw myself in many lines and on many pages. And I want to say something about the way that the way that Diane Seuss weaves a wold that is lush, the characters, the family, the friends, the milkweed, the colors 	Transcription	
829	852	AR: connecting the light of dawn to a dish rag, the light of evening to a menstreaul rag, the ways that immensities, bodily realities, and social bullshit are all real but all expand and contract in this magic space that she creates.	Transcription	
854	874	AR: She invokes Keats a lot and I think that the spirit of Keats was very much with her as she wrote these sonnets. To me Keats is the one who liquified the sonnet and Diane has pure liquid quick silver mind. 	Transcription	
876	899	AR: These are poems that bear witness to AIDS, to the mother-daughter relationship, to the mother-son relationship, to addiction, to bad love, to love gone wrong, to sickness and tormet of desire. Basically all the hings youd want from poetry. 	Transcription	
900	913	AR: Anyway I better shut up and let you hear from these two and I hope that you'll make them read long. Thank you so much CA Conrad and Diane Seuss.	Transcription	
914	915	Applause 	Environment	
915	925	Gallery view of 16 to 20 people clapping, CA pops up in the lower right corner at 15:15	Image	
920	934	CA: Wow, that was an amazing introduction. *Claps hands* Thank you so much Christina for having me, I am very excited to be reading with Diane and thank you so much everyone who makes the Woodberry Poetry Room work. 	Transcription	
928	934	Split Screen with CD on the left and CA on the right	Image	
935		CA in speaker view. They are a person with long hair, black painted nails, glasses, a necklace with cand floral blouse. It is a close-up and behind them is greenery. They talk with their hands very emphatically and frequently.	Image	
936	946	CA: That was an incredible introduction. And I mean Ariana basically explained most of the ritual I did to write this new book. So I don't really need to.	Image	
947	971	CA: I just wanna add one little thing before I share the screen to read the poems, is that the new book came to me when I was working on the last book,. I was at this marvelous place in New Hampshire called McDowell and I was in the forest working on a ritual to overcome a very serious debilitating deblitating depression after a boyfriend of mine was murdered.	Transcription	
973	986	CA:  But it was when that work it was when that grabbed a hold of me and worked out there in the forest when this book came in And the idea, I can't really explain all of it is is too much to explain but I just wanna say this briefly.	Transcription	
987	1007	CA: I was focusing on the recordings of these creatures who become extinct in my lifetime because I was thinking about ecopoetics as more well more than just a conversation about degraded soil air and water, also about vibrational absence.	Transcription	ecopoetics
1008	1030	CA: When a species leaves the planet they take all of their sounds with them. And I wanted to bring that back to the air a little bit as I was doing this around the country, flooding my body, starting at my feet and moving up to my head. There were actually nine ingredients that's just one working with recordings but I would rather shared some poetry right now. And then I share the screen.	Transcription	
1030	1051	CA begins share screen in speaker mode. There is an image of the book cover for Amanda Paradise: Resurrect Extinct Vibration. The cover looks like Wave Books publication, simple cream-colored cover with an all caps font and stars under the title. They are on the right side of the screen and their image is about a third the size of the shared screen. They scroll down and change the scale of the view to be a bit more distant for the poems. And then scroll back up to the cover.	Image	
1041	1051	CA: Amanda Paradise...I also wanted to thank everybody at Wave Books for taking such beautiful care of my poems. 	Transcription	Wave
1059		Screen share of first poem in Amanda Paradise. It is called, ONLY IN STACKING BOOKS CAN THE TREE FEEL ITS WEIGHT AGAIN. It is a concrete poem with an assymetrical and bent alignment. It curves in and out a number of times with the last line ending more left aligned than the first. And a good deal of variation in line length. CA remains on screen during the share.	Image	
1059	1151	CA reads ONLY IN STACKING BOOKS CAN THE TREE FEEL ITS WEIGHT AGAIN	Poem	jingoism, sex, love, EricaKaufman
1153	1169	CA: This is a good moment to just briefly mention that one of things that I confronted about myself when doing this ritual was my guilt at enjoying doing the ritual with all these recordings of extinct animals 	Transcription	
1169	1178	CA: And that guilt braided with my guilt of...so many friends and lovers who died of AIDS and they just appear over and over again in this book	Transcription	
1179	1182	CA scrolls down the manuscript in their share screen to the next poem, another very curved shape poem: ACCLIMATING TO THE DISCOMFORT OF THE SYSTEM BREAKING BENEATH US	Image

1272	1275	CA scrolls down the manuscript in their share screen to the next poem, MEMORIES OF WHY I STOPPED BEING A MAN, for Jason Dodge. This poem's shape begins with a far right alignment curving like a helix to the center of the page. 	Image	
1276	1287	CA: I wanted to say I'm really prou--I'm really excited about this. Angela Connit who is this really brilliant art curator in New York City working with the Elizabeth foundation for art 	Transcription	
1287	1304	CA:invited me to be part of the Boy Box show at their gallery just a couple months ago. And she asked me how I wanted to participate and I said I wanted one of my poems to be in the show. So because of the content of the show, its about toxic masculinity	Transcription	masculinity
1304	1325	CA: and that is exactly what this poem is dedicated to, she brilliantly printed this poem on six feet of chiffon and had it dangling from the ceiling. It was absolutely amazing! My love to Angela Connit. And I dedicate this poem to my favorite living visual artist Jason Dodge who is just extraordinary! 	Transcription
