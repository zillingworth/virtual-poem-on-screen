323	346	BK: I also wanna say. Um, I think I'm recording this. I have this meeting set up to where it's supposed to automatically record, but if you would like to record I believe I also have it set up to where you can just press record and you should be able to 	Transcript
347	362	BK: And if anyone has, if anyone is trying to record and is struggling to record well let me know send me a message and I'll see what I can do. (Bradley changes his Zoom background to The Northern Lights) yeah, that seems more right.	Transcript

400	286	BK: Um, Bernadette are you ready? Bernadette Mayer: Yes, dear.	Transcript
287	419	BK: Uh, well, the first thing I wanna ask you is did you see anyting terrific or fascinating in your yard today? 	Transcript

432	437	BM: It is a tree that turns orange. (Laughter)	Transcript
438	462	BK: Well, I'm glad you said that because I also wanted to ask you about color, I've heard that you have some ideas or you like to talk about the color of letters of the alphabet. And I was just going to ask you to say a bit about the color letters.	Transcript
469	479	BM: Oh, uh, ok, well A is red. B is pink. C is ochre. D is black.  	Transcript

561	575	BM: Well nothing really. Every synesthete has a different color for every letter so somebody's else's letters would would be a different color. BK: I see. 	Transcript
576	589	BK: Do you have these memorized or? Do they come to you differently each time. BM: I can't hear. BK: I say do they come to you differently or are they always the same each time? 	Transcript
590	611	BM: No they're always the same. They've been the same since I was a child. Just a letter is a certain color and it just stays that way forever	Transcript
612	630	Even if you know like Nabokov (changing to Russian pronunciation) NabOkov said there playing with blocks when he was a kid, they're all the wrong colors  and his mother said yes I know. 	Transcript
633	645	BK: Did the colors of the letters ever seem like the wrong colors to you? BM: Yeah they do. But I always enjoyed the fact that E was green. 	Transcript
646	655	BK: Because it mean as I said very often to my grand daughter it means free money is green. BM laughs. 	Transcript
656	665	BK: I'm gonna keep my eyes open for the letter E now. BM: What? Philip Good: Keep your eyes open for the letter E. BK: Can I ask you one more question?   	Transcript
666	686	BM: MMmhmmM. BK: I wanted to ask you what you favorite thought that you've had today was. BM: Yeah, um, gee. PG: The maple tree. The tree. in the creek. 	Transcript
688	710	BM: The um, OH! Well, I dont know if it's my favorite thought but we were walking by the Kinderhook creek and we could see the trees above and I pointed to this really orange tree. And I asked Phil who was with me. Is this our tree? 	Transcript
711	730	BM: Now this is not a favorite thought. It is just an odd thought to think that a tree belongs to you. Sound of someone watching TV (maybe Narcos?) very loudly. back to BK in speaker: now you found yourself with this odd thought.  	Transcript
