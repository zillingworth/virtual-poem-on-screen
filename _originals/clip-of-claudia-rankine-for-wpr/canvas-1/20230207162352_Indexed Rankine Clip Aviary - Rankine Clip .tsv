0:00:03	37	Cut to CR in speaker view, medium-close up, eye contact maintained, modern living room with white walls, red couches, abstract color field paintings, a hanging pothos plant, blinds are drawn, but the light outside is bright, likely Rankine's home in Southern California 	Notes	
0:00:03	0:00:26	CR: Thank you, thank you, Professor Gates, Christina Davis, and everyone for spending this evening with me. I've been looking forward. I'm going to start by showing a video because why not? And then I will read. 	Notes	Platform
0:00:26	36	CR: So first I'm going to share the screen. That's always a point of anxiety...will this work	Notes	Platform
37	139	Share screen of a police training video on bias. The first person shot from a medium-long, low angle. Officer 1 is a white woman police officer with short hair in a pink shirt with a badge in her belt strap and a remote control in her hand. The room appears to be a basement with brown walls, one computer, a chair, a desk, a white board. Camera pans to a second officer, a Black man, in a suit and tie, the police chief. The camera pans again to a white woman looking at them. In Just Us, three stills from this video occur on page 138 (but of the objecting officer in the audience who is off screen) and Rankine transcribes the interaction using their names in the pages that follow. The section in the book is titled "white male privilege"	Notes	Whiteness, Policing
0:00:37	78	Offscreen male voice: Because if you can have a basis for where the number comes from and what the situation is that puts them in the situation. Officer 1: Mmmhhhmm Off-screen male voice: Are they more likely to be in this situation than someone who's not transgender? Officer 1: Mmhmm yes. Off-screen male voice: Which I don't know what that is, I'm just saying. My wife has never been part of police violence. Most of the people that I know have never been, accused the police of violence. So I guess I don't get where that's supposed to come from.	Notes	Policing
79	98	Offscreen female voice: It's a white male privilege so you wouldn't know. Off-screen male voice: I'm sorry?! Off-screen woman: It's a white male privilege so you wouldn't know. Officer 1: I can end this right now, ok? Chief: We want to keep it safe and professional. That's my role and objective. So I don't want to focus on the statistics. Off-screen voice: CHIEF!	Notes	Whiteness
99	136	Chief: Quite frankly. Off-screen voice: *interrupts* SERIOUSLY, I'M ASKING A LEGITIMATE QUESTION. And I've been taught white privilege are you serious? I find that extremely offensive. Voices overlap. Off-screen voice: In America?! I will leave. I file it on your desk. Chief: We're not talking about white privilege here. We're trying to focus on a different demographic. I'm going to keep this professional. And I apologize if anybody if offended. This data that we have here	Notes	Whiteness, Policing
137	274	Cut back to CR in speaker view	Notes	
137	178	CR: OK, so when the white woman who told the police officer (she was also a police officer) that he couldn't understand why transgender people were targeted by the police  and she said you can't understand because of your white male privilege that woman was put on leave and was given the position of no longer having any contact with anyone in the police force.	Notes	Whiteness, Policing
179	203	CR: So thats how she was to live out her time in the police force because she was a bad influence basically. And he the man who brought the charges against her for saying white male privilege, nothing happened to him. So that's that's the state of discourse in 2019. I don't know if things would have changed by now.	Notes	Whiteness, Policing
204	233	CR:But I wanted to begin with a quote from Paul Celan, he says, What times are these when a conversation is almost a crime? Because it includes so much made explicit. What times are these when a conversation is almost a crime? And with that I will start reading initially the opening poem from Just Us.	Notes
