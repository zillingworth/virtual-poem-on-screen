![Poster for Generocity (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70542175/217357786-5b739942-a18d-4332-a22d-69be7d5b30de.jpeg)

<p> "The Virtual Poem Embodied on Screen" examines Zoom poetry readings as potentially overlooked artifacts that reveal how poets and their audiences adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Zoom readings in this project are sourced from local poetry cultures, but also institutional archives like the Harvard Woodberry Poetry Room. The above poster, drawn by Sarah La Puerta, was created for a Zoom poetry reading to benefit the late poet Bernadette Mayer. The poster, from the Generocity Reading's Facebook event, shows the names of poets around the world, from Berlin to Austin, who assembled on Zoom in 2020 to read their work and raise money to buy a generator to heat Mayer's home in upstate New York. The Generocity Reading is one example of how Zoom poetry readings alter the typical form of poetry performances through the use of share screen, navigating sociotechnical constraints, and aspects of the platform's visual modality like direct address, frontality, and split screen.</p>
