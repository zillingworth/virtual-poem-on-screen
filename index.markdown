<p> "The Virtual Poem Embodied on Screen" examines Zoom poetry readings as potentially overlooked artifacts that reveal how poets and their audiences adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Zoom readings in this project are sourced from local poetry cultures, but also institutional archives like the Harvard Woodberry Poetry Room. The above poster, drawn by Sarah La Puerta, was created for a Zoom poetry reading to benefit the late poet Bernadette Mayer. This Zoom reading was organized by Cuneiform Press, a small press publishing poetry and artists' books, based in Austin, Texas. The poster, from the Generocity Reading's Facebook event, shows the names of poets around the world, from Berlin to Austin, who assembled on Zoom in 2020 to read their work in support of an influential New York School poet in need. The Generocity Reading raised money, through audience donation and purchases of books and broadsides printed by Cuneiform, to buy a generator to heat Mayer's home in upstate New York. The Generocity Reading is one example of how Zoom poetry readings alter the typical form of poetry performances through the use of share screen, navigating sociotechnical constraints, and aspects of the platform's visual modality like direct address, frontality, and split screen.</p>
